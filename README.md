# FORK INFO

This is a fork of adrian154's fork of Robert David Graham's [MASSCAN](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan), with added support for pinging Minecraft servers and saving the response as a banner.

My fork makes it *only* banner check for Minecraft servers, makes it work on any port, and contains an extended exclude list.
